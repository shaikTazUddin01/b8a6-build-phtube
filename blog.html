            <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><span class="font-bold">Var : </span>Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
                The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
                
                var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><span class="font-bold">Let : </span>A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><span class="font-bold">Const : </span>Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-12">2.Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><span class="font-bold">Ans : </span>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-12">3.What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg"><span class="font-bold">Ans : </span> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
